        <h2>Introduction</h2>
        <p>The premise that our society is different from what it would have been without the computer revolution is generally accepted. Is our society better than it would have been without the revolution? Is our society worse? Would your answer differ if your position within society were different? Technology evolution is inevitable with human growth, and having computers in certain things such as credit card machines and phones can be convenient. Overall, society is better off running on tech if society can continue to function with it as a convenience rather than a way of living.</p>
